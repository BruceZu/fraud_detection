## Things that Went AWESOME!

* Investigating and making assumptions on the data we had for feature engineering, making sure there was no leakage from the columns.
* We all really carried an equal weight. No one took on more than anyone else. I felt that everyone was participating equally. We checked in together really often but also allowed for people to go off and focus on what they were doing in quiet/focus mode.
* We worked fairly smoothly and managed time and work during the first day.
* Adapted to a different type of case study - focused on deliverables and producing a strong git repository.
Helped us focus team effort on infrastructure, less on model.
* We set the baseline model up very quickly. Our EDA was productive and we did not spend too much time on it. We spent time exploring different models and grid searching.
* I think a lot of the intuition on which features might be important and being able to examine them quickly and efficiently is something that I did well relative to other case studies. I also feel like we did well getting up a base model quickly.
* Dividing up the work for the most part. There wasn't too much redundancy in what people were doing. We tried to collaborate using git as much as we could, and although we ran into merge conflicts now and then, we got more comfortable with it.
* We made the most of the human resources. We found splitting into pairs and working together was best, pair programming!
* We managed to work well with Github, avoiding merge conflicts and working on our branches. This definitely saved us time!
* From the beginning, we had a good consistent understanding about the data structure which helped with combining work.
* Always keeping the end goal in mind.


## Things that Could Be Improved

* Did not investigate why the model was performing too good. Should have spent some time on that instead of spending time on different models and tuning them.
* Tunnel vision. Sometimes I noticed that we were spending too much time on one small feature to engineer, rather at taking a step back and evaluating if it was worth that amount of effort. Also, some of us are faster workers than others, and we occasionally repeated work because some of us had gone ahead and not communicated where we were - only really on one occasion though.
* We, as always, should have focused and devoted more time to the presentation and deliverables. In this case that's what really demonstrates our effort, not hours of group EDA and getting comfortable with the data and trying tons of models.
* We could have started the web part sooner; it was new for all of us and we started late and didn't sync as much as we should have.
* Deferred more to group-mates’ leadership, encouraged more independent work, discouraged four of us around 1 computer (more individual work).
* We could have a more clear plan since we were not very familiar with Web app and we should spend more time on tweaking that. We could collaborate more efficiently by tackling different tasks at the same time.
* Model iteration: Each time we added new features, we were still considering and grid searching across all classification models, although Random Forest was best each time...
* Would have liked to start the web app earlier so that we had a basic understanding of what should happen and how it works.
* We should have spent more time understanding the problem as a whole, not just reading the instructions as they are. Then we can approach problems in a more holistic way.
* Read instructions first!
* I wish I had been much more efficient with the time spent on attempting to create a web template. It took me way too long to find a template and wasted a lot of time on reading about how to actually do what I wanted.
* We should have focused on the web app earlier since our audience was on the business side. Also, our model scores were really high and we suspected some issue, but didn't discover the source of leakage until it was too late – so we should've really investigated that earlier. 
* I didn't read the instructions well, so I misunderstood many things especially during the 1st day.
* Back tracking - What you want to show in the presentation or any other way to want to show your results? Ask this and start doing EDA, models etc. accordingly.
